# MockMate - Mom Test Notes

**Goal:** Understand the current pain points, workflows, and workaround behaviors of people preparing for technical interviews, specifically around practicing with others.

## The 3 Big Questions (Pre-Interview Prep)
1. How do candidates currently practice for technical interviews?
2. What happens when they try to find someone to practice with? What is the actual pain point (flakey partners, finding peers of the same level, scheduling, awkwardness)?
3. What existing tools or communities are they using, and what are their limitations?

## Simulated Interview 1: "College Senior looking for New Grad Roles"
**Demographic:** College Senior, actively applying, has an upcoming interview in 2 weeks.

*Our goal: Find out how they practice algorithms and if they do it with others.*

**Me:** How are you preparing for your upcoming interviews?  
**User 1:** I'm mostly grinding LeetCode and watching NeetCode videos. I try to do 2-3 problems a day.  

**Me:** Talk me through the last time you felt stuck or needed help preparing.  
**User 1:** Last week, I had a mock interview with a friend. We just screenshared on Zoom.  

**Me:** How did that go?  
**User 1:** It was okay, but a bit awkward. My friend already works at FAANG, so he gave good feedback, but I felt really judged and nervous. Also, it took us 3 days to find a 1-hour slot that worked for both of us.  

**Me:** Have you tried finding other people to practice with besides your friend?  
**User 1:** Yeah, I posted in our university's CS Discord asking if anyone wanted to mock interview each other.  

**Me:** What happened?  
**User 1:** Someone DM'd me, we set up a time, but they ghosted me 10 minutes before the call. I ended up just doing a LeetCode problem by myself.  

**Me:** Have you looked into platforms specifically for finding practice partners?  
**User 1:** I know about Pramp, but I've heard you sometimes get paired with people who don't know the language, or they just stay silent and don't actually act like an interviewer. I haven't really tried it though.

### Signals:
- ☇ **Pain:** Ghosting/flaky peers from Discord.
- ☇ **Pain:** Scheduling friction even with friends.
- ☐ **Obstacle:** Intimidation/awkwardness when practicing with more experienced friends.
- ⤴ **Workaround:** Using informal CS Discords (with poor results).

## Simulated Interview 2: "Mid-level Engineer Prepping for Senior Roles"
**Demographic:** Mid-level engineer with 3 years of experience, aiming for a Senior role, specifically worried about System Design.

**Me:** Talk me through how you've been preparing for system design interviews recently.  
**User 2:** I read the "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" book and watched some YouTube videos.  

**Me:** When was the last time you actually practiced a system design interview out loud?  
**User 2:** Probably 3 years ago when I got my current job. Honestly, I haven't practiced speaking it out loud yet for this round.  

**Me:** Why haven't you practiced it out loud?  
**User 2:** It's hard to practice alone. You need someone to push back on your design and ask questions.  

**Me:** Have you tried finding someone to do that with you?  
**User 2:** I thought about asking my coworkers, but I don't want them to know I'm looking for a new job.  

**Me:** So how are you making sure you're ready for the actual interview?  
**User 2:** I bought a course on Educative.io. I'm just hoping that reading through the case studies will be enough. I might try to talk to myself in the mirror over the weekend. I looked at one coaching service, but they wanted $200 an hour for a mock interview and I'm not paying that.  

**Me:** Why didn't you look for free peer-to-peer options?  
**User 2:** Most people looking for free practice are juniors. I need someone who actually understands distributed systems to mock me, otherwise it's a waste of time. I don't know where to find peers exactly at my level.

### Signals:
- ☇ **Pain:** Confidentiality makes practicing with colleagues impossible.
- ☇ **Pain:** Finding peers at the *same experience level* is a major blocker (quality control).
- ☐ **Obstacle:** Unwilling to pay $200/hr for professional coaches.
- ⤴ **Workaround:** "Hoping" reading is enough, or talking to a mirror. Avoids peer-to-peer due to assumed low quality matches.

## Simulated Interview 3: "Bootcamp Grad Seeking First Tech Job"
**Demographic:** Career switcher, finished a bootcamp 3 months ago, actively applying.

**Me:** Walk me through your typical week of interview prep right now.  
**User 3:** It's mostly sending out applications and working on my portfolio. I don't get many interviews.  

**Me:** When you do get an interview, how do you prep?  
**User 3:** The bootcamp had a career services team that did one mock behavioral interview with me. But for technical stuff, I use ChatGPT.  

**Me:** Tell me more about using ChatGPT. How exactly do you do it?  
**User 3:** I paste a coding problem in and ask it to act like an interviewer and ask me questions one by one.  

**Me:** Does that work well for you?  
**User 3:** It's okay, but I can just ignore it or ask it for the answer when I get frustrated. There's no real pressure.  

**Me:** Have you tried practicing with other people from your bootcamp cohort?  
**User 3:** A little bit right after we graduated. But honestly, it was kind of a case of the blind leading the blind. We both didn't really know what a real hiring manager was looking for. We ended up just debugging each other's syntax errors.  

**Me:** What's the biggest thing you wish you had for interview prep right now?  
**User 3:** Feedback from someone who actually hires people. I have no idea if my code is "good enough" or if my communication style is right, and an AI can't really judge my communication.

### Signals:
- ⤴ **Workaround:** Using ChatGPT for mock interviews.
- ☇ **Pain:** AI lacks real pressure or human communication feedback.
- ☐ **Obstacle:** Practicing with peers isn't seen as valuable ("blind leading the blind").
- ⚽ **Goal:** Wants feedback from someone with real hiring experience, not just peer-level feedback.
